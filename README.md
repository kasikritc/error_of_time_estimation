# Welcome to the Error of Time Estimation Project!

This is my Secondary 3 Mathematics Project which I integrated my knowledge data science into it.

In order to run my .ipnyb files, please install Jupyter Notbebook from https://jupyter.org/install.html.

# Introduction

Research has shown that one of the main reasons why humans procrastinate is the fact that we tend to underestimate how long it will take you to complete the task at hand, and you also underestimate how quickly youâ€™ll get it done. Experts have been suggesting people to break down the large work into smaller subtasks and reevaluate the time of each subtask as our estimations will become more accurate.

Why do these experts recommend this particular tip? Does the size of work really affect how we estimate the time needed?

This project is to prove the technique by finding out whether the reduction of sizes of input (i.e. the reduction of time intervals) increases the accuracy of estimations (i.e. percentage errors of time estimations).
